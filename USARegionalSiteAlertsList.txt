#this is the file format for the Regional and Local AlertsConfig.tf files.
#You would use two separate files, site names can be the same but the 
#Webhook name and then the URL would be different on the Local file for each site
#The Webhook name and URL would likely be the same on the regional file since 
#the intention is that all sites in that region would get the same configuration
<site name>|<Webhook name>|<WEbhook URL>
